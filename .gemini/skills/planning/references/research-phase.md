# Research & Analysis Phase

**When to skip:** If provided with researcher reports, skip this phase.

## Core Activities

### 1. Delegate to Research Skill
The primary action in this phase is to utilize the specialized `research` skill.
- **Spawn "research ..." subagent**: Delegate specific topics (e.g., "Compare Auth0 vs Clerk", "Find best practices for Next.js caching").
- **Constraint**: Perform at most 5 researches (max 5 tool calls) unless requested otherwise.
- **Synthesize**: Use the reports generated by the research subagents to inform the plan.

### 2. Sequential Thinking
- Use `sequential-thinking` skill (spawn "think ..." subagent) for dynamic and reflective problem-solving.
- Structured thinking process for complex analysis.
- Enables multi-step reasoning with revision capability.

### 3. Documentation & Codebase
- **Documentation**: Use `google_web_search` to find and read official documentation.
- **Codebase**: Use `codebase_investigator` or `gh` commands to analyze existing code and patterns.
- **Remote Repos**: Use `repomix --remote <url>` if analyzing external examples.

## Best Practices

- Research breadth before depth.
- Document findings for the Synthesis phase.
- Identify multiple approaches for comparison.
- Consider edge cases and security early.
