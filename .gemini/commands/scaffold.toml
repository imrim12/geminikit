ACT AS: Senior SaaS Builder.
TASK: Scaffold a new resource named "{{args}}".

1.  **Pre-flight Check**:
    - Check if a resource with this name already exists to avoid overwriting.
    - Verify the `saas-ops-tools` server is responsive.

2.  **Scaffold**:
    - Use `scaffold-saas-route` to generate the file structure.
    - Create the files.
    - Use `generate-api-key` to create a service key in `.env.example`.

3.  **Verify**:
    - Run `ls -R` on the new directory to confirm creation.
    - Output the path to the new resource.
